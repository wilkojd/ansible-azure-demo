# Ansible-azure-demo
The scripts in this repo showcase some of what can be achieved using Ansible modules to manage resources on Azure.

## Setup & Pre-requisites

### Ansible
To use the Ansible scripts in this repo, you will need to:
1. Ensure python & pip are installed. `python --version` returns `Python 2.7.10`. `pip --version` returns `pip 9.0.1`
2. Install ansible `sudo pip install ansible`
3. Install azure python SDK `sudo pip install "azure==2.0.0rc5‚Äù`
4. Ensure python bin folder is on the PATH. On a Mac, I see `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin` in the output from `echo $PATH`
5. Turn off strict host key checking by adding an ansible config file at ~/.ansible.cfg
```
[defaults]
host_key_checking = False
```
6. Confirm ansible is available `ansible --version` returns `ansible 2.3.0.0`

### Azure
1. Create a *service principal* application with an existing Azure account and assign it as an owner of the azure account, in order to authenticate Ansible with azure account. The steps to do this are detailed at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal . **N.B. The URL for the application does not have to be a working URL, see http://blog.davidebbo.com/2014/12/azure-service-principal.html.**
2. Get the required values of client_id (the app id), secret (the key secret), tenant (as per instructions in official azure article from step 1), and subscription_id (found in billing/subscriptions). Save them into ~/.azure/credentials like this:

```
[default]
subscription_id=
client_id=
secret=
tenant=
```

## Usage

- To setup two new VMs in Azure, run `ansible-playbook create-vms.yml`
- To grant access to these VMs to a new keypair, run `./add-new-user.sh`. The private key `newuserkey` can then be used to login to the VMs using a command like `ssh -i newuserkey azure_user@host`
- To revoke access to these VMs for the key, uncomment the line `#state: absent` in add-user-to-group.yml by removing the leading #. Then run `ansible-playbook add-user-to-group.yml`
- To delete all of the resources generated in Azure, run `ansible-playbook remove-all.yml`
